Prompt

In this assignment, you are required to design and implement an FAQ Chatbot that responds to user questions about a specific product. The chatbot should use a Large Language Model (LLM), such as OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or similar, and the LangChain framework to manage prompts, context, and data retrieval.

You may select any consumer product, such as home appliances, grocery delivery, online retail, or streaming services. The chatbot's responses should be based on relevant and realistic content sourced from:

    Open datasets available on platforms like Kaggle or Google Dataset Search
    FAQs or product information from official company website 

You must write the code in Python and utilize LangChain along with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI API). You may incorporate commonly used libraries such as Pandas, ChromaDB, and FAISS.

Your submission must include two core components:

    source code (written in Python and provided in .py format)
    a report that follows the guidelines outlined below 

Report Guidelines

Your report must include the following sections:

    Title Page
    Name and Purpose of the Chatbot
    NLP/LLM Methods Used
    Dataset Information
    Libraries, Toolkits, and Framework
    Application Design and Implementation
    Instructions for Running the Chatbot
    Results
    Discussion and Insights
    References 

Sample Report Template

Developing an FAQ Chatbot Using LangChain and LLM APIs

1. Name and Purpose of the Chatbot

    Provide the name of your chatbot and explain its purpose in one paragraph. 

2. NLP/LLM Methods Used

    Describe which NLP/LLM methods were applied and why they were chosen. 

3. Dataset Information

    3.1 Dataset source/link
    3.2 Number of records
    3.3 Number of features
    3.4 Description of features: Feature Name, Description, Data Type
    3.5 Preprocessing steps 

4. Libraries, Toolkits, and Frameworks

    List all libraries used and explain their roles. 

5. Application Design and Implementation

    Describe how the chatbot works, including data flow, model training, and prediction. 

6. Instructions for Running the Chatbot

    Provide a step-by-step guide on how to execute the code. Include environment setup or dependencies. 

7. Results

    Include screenshots that demonstrate the chatbot in operation and display the prediction results. 

8. Discussion and Insights

    Reflect on your model's performance, limitations, and potential improvements. 

9. References

    List all data sources, libraries, and references in APA style. 

Formatting & Sources

Please write your paper in the APA Style format. You may refer to the course material for supporting evidence, but you must also use at least 3 credible outside sources and cite them using APA format. Please include a mix of both primary and secondary sources. If you use any Study.com lessons as sources, please also cite them in APA (including the lesson title and instructor's name).

    Primary sources are first-hand accounts such as interviews, advertisements, speeches, company documents, statements, and press releases published by the consumer product in question.
    Secondary sources come from peer-reviewed scholarly journals, such as Artificial Intelligence Review, Nature Machine Intelligence, and IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. You may use sources like JSTOR, Google Scholar, and ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and EBSCOhost to find articles from these journals. Secondary sources may also come from reputable websites with .gov, .edu, or .org in the domain. (Wikipedia is not a reputable source, though the sources listed in Wikipedia articles may be acceptable.)
